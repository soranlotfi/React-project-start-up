React props (short for "properties") are a way of passing data from a parent component to a child
component in React. Props allow components to be reusable and modular, by letting them receive
different data and render accordingly.

React state refers to the current data or values that a React component holds and manages
internally.It is used to store and manage component-specific data that changes over time,
such as user input, user interface state, or data fetched from an API.
